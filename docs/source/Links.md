### Literature

- Richard Bartle *Designing Virtual Worlds*  ([amazon page](http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Virtual-Worlds-Richard-Bartle/dp/0131018167)) - Essential reading for the design of any persistent game
world, written by the co-creator of the original game *MUD*. Published in 2003 but it's still as
relevant now as when it came out. Covers everything you need to know and then some.
- Zed A. Shaw *Learn Python the Hard way* ([homepage](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)) - Despite
the imposing name this book is for the absolute Python/programming beginner. One learns the language
by gradually creating a small text game! It has been used by multiple users before moving on to
Evennia. *Update: This used to be free to read online, this is no longer the case.*
- David M. Beazley *Python Essential Reference (4th ed)* ([amazon
page](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Essential-Reference-David-Beazley/dp/0672329786/)) - Our
recommended book on Python; it not only efficiently summarizes the language but is also an excellent
reference to the standard library for more experienced Python coders.
- Luciano Ramalho, *Fluent Python* ([o'reilly
page](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do)) - This is an excellent book for experienced
Python coders willing to take their code to the next level. A great read with a lot of useful info
also for veteran Pythonistas.
- Richard Cantillon *An Essay on Economic Theory* ([free
pdf](http://mises.org/books/essay_on_economic_theory_cantillon.pdf)) - A very good English
translation of *Essai sur la Nature du Commerce en Général*, one of the foundations of modern
economic theory. Written in 1730 but the translation is annotated and the essay is actually very
easy to follow also for a modern reader. Required reading if you think of implementing a sane game
economic system.
