This screenshot shows a vanilla [install](./Getting-Started) of the just started Evennia MUD server.
In the bottom window we can see the log messages from the running server.

In the top left window we see the default website of our new game displayed in a web browser (it has
shrunk to accomodate the smaller screen). Evennia contains its own webserver to serve this page. The
default site shows some brief info about the database. From here you can also reach Django's *admin
interface* for editing the database online.

To the upper right is the included web-browser client showing a connection to the server on port
4001. This allows users to access the game without downloading a mud client separately.

Bottom right we see a login into the stock game using a third-party MUD client
([Mudlet](http://www.mudlet.org)). This connects to the server via the telnet protocol on port 4000.
