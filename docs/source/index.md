```important::

    This is the v0.9.5 documentation of Evennia, originally converted from the old
    `evennia wiki <https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki>`_ at 2020-10-11 18:06:03.062022.
    While we will fix outright mistakes, minor typos and visual conversion issues will **not** be 
    addressed in this version.
    A new and refactored version of the docs is being prepared for version 1.0 of Evennia.
