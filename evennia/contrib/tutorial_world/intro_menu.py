Evennia contrib - Griatch 2020

This contrib is an intro-menu for general MUD and evennia usage using the
EvMenu menu-templating system.

EvMenu templating is a way to create a menu using a string-format instead
of creating all nodes manually. Of course, for full functionality one must
still create the goto-callbacks.

## NODE about_muds

|g** About MUDs **|n

The term '|wMUD|n' stands for Multi-user-Dungeon or -Dimension. A MUD is
primarily played by inserting text |wcommands|n and getting text back.

MUDS were the |wprecursors|n to graphical MMORPG-style games like World of
Warcraft. While not as mainstream as they once were, comparing a text-game to a
graphical game is like comparing a book to a movie - it's just a different
experience altogether.

MUDs are |wdifferent|n from Interactive Fiction (IF) in that they are multiplayer
and usually has a consistent game world with many stories and protagonists
acting at the same time.

Like there are many different styles of graphical MMOs, there are |wmany
variations|n of MUDs: They can be slow-paced or fast. They can cover fantasy,
sci-fi, horror or other genres. They can allow PvP or not and be casual or
hardcore, strategic, tactical, turn-based or play in real-time.

Whereas 'MUD' is arguably the most well-known term, there are other terms
centered around particular game engines - such as MUSH, MOO, MUX, MUCK, LPMuds,
ROMs, Diku and others. Many people that played MUDs in the past used one of
these existing families of text game-servers, whether they knew it or not.

|cEvennia|n is a newer text game engine designed to emulate almost any existing
gaming style you like and possibly any new ones you can come up with!

## OPTIONS

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## NODE about_evennia

|g** About Evennia **|n

|cEvennia|n is a Python game engine for creating multiplayer online text-games
(aka MUDs, MUSHes, MUX, MOOs...). It is open-source and |wfree to use|n, also for
commercial projects (BSD license).

Out of the box, Evennia provides a |wworking, if empty game|n. Whereas you can play
via traditional telnet MUD-clients, the server runs your game's website and
offers a |wHTML5 webclient|n so that people can play your game in their browser
without downloading anything extra.

Evennia deliberately |wdoes not|n hard-code any game-specific things like
combat-systems, races, skills, etc. They would not match what just you wanted
anyway! Whereas we do have optional contribs with many examples, most of our
users use them as inspiration to make their own thing.

Evennia is developed entirely in |wPython|n, using modern developer practices.
The advantage of text is that even a solo developer or small team can
realistically make a competitive multiplayer game (as compared to a graphical
MMORPG which is one of the most expensive game types in existence to develop).
Many also use Evennia as a |wfun way to learn Python|n!

## NODE using webclient

|g** Using the Webclient **|n

|RNote: This is only relevant if you use Evennia's HTML5 web client. If you use a
third-party (telnet) mud-client, you can skip this section.|n

Evennia's web client is (for a local install) found by pointing your browser to

    |yhttp://localhost:4001/webclient|n

For a live example, the public Evennia demo can be found at

    |yhttps://demo.evennia.com/webclient|n

The web client starts out having two panes - the input-pane for entering commands
and the main window.

- Use |y<Return>|n (or click the arrow on the right) to send your input.
- Use |yShift + <up/down-arrow>|n to step back and forth in your command-history.
- Use |yShift + <Return>|n to add a new line to your input without sending.

There is also some |wextra|n info to learn about customizing the webclient.

## NODE customizing the webclient

|g** Extra hints on customizing the Webclient **|n

|y1)|n The panes of the webclient can be resized and you can create additional panes.

- Press the little  plus (|w+|n) sign in the top left and a new tab will appear.
- Click and drag the tab and pull it far to the right and release when it creates two
  panes next to each other.

|y2)|n You can have certain server output only appear in certain panes.

- In your new rightmost pane, click the diamond (⯁) symbol at the top.
- Unselect everything and make sure to select "testing".
- Click the diamond again so the menu closes.
- Next, write "|ytest Hello world!|n". A test-text should appear in your rightmost pane!

|y3)|n You can customize general webclient settings by pressing the cogwheel in the upper
left corner. It allows to change things like font and if the client should play sound.

The "message routing" allows for rerouting text matching a certain regular expression (regex)
to a web client pane with a specific tag that you set yourself.

|y4)|n Close the right-hand pane with the |wX|n in the rop right corner.

# we get here via goto_command_demo_help()

## NODE command_demo_help

|g** Playing the game **|n

Evennia has about |w90 default commands|n. They include useful administration/building
commands and a few limited "in-game" commands to serve as examples. They are intended
to be changed, extended and modified as you please.

First to try is |yhelp|n. This lists all commands |wcurrently|n available to you.

Use |yhelp <topic>|n to get specific help. Try |yhelp help|n to get help on using
the help command. For your game you could add help about your game, lore, rules etc
as well.

At the moment you only have |whelp|n and some |wChannel Names|n (the '<menu commands>'
is just a placeholder to indicate you are using this menu).

We'll add more commands as we get to them in this tutorial - but we'll only
cover a small handful. Once you exit you'll find a lot more! Now let's try
those channels ...

## OPTIONS

    next;n: Talk on Channels -> talk on channels
    back;b: Using the webclient -> goto_cleanup_cmdsets(gotonode='using webclient')
    back to start;start: start
    >: talk on channels

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## NODE talk on channels

|g** Talk on Channels **|n

|wChannels|n are like in-game chatrooms. The |wChannel Names|n help-category
holds the names of the channels available to you right now. One such channel is
|wpublic|n. Use |yhelp public|n to see how to use it. Try it:

    |ypublic Hello World!|n

This will send a message to the |wpublic|n channel where everyone on that
channel can see it. If someone else is on your server, you may get a reply!

Evennia can link its in-game channels to external chat networks. This allows
you to talk with people not actually logged into the game. For
example, the online Evennia-demo links its |wpublic|n channel to the #evennia
IRC support channel.

## OPTIONS

    next;n: Talk to people in-game -> goto_command_demo_comms()
    back;b: Finding help -> goto_command_demo_help()
    back to start;start: start
    >: goto_command_demo_comms()

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# we get here via goto_command_demo_comms()

## NODE comms_demo_start

|g** Talk to people in-game **|n

You can also chat with people inside the game. If you try |yhelp|n now you'll
find you have a few more commands available for trying this out.

    |ysay Hello there!|n
    |y'Hello there!|n

|wsay|n is used to talk to people in the same location you are. Everyone in the
room will see what you have to say. A single quote |y'|n is a  convenient shortcut.

    |ypose smiles|n
    |y:smiles|n

|wpose|n (or |wemote|n) describes what you do to those nearby. This is a very simple
command by default, but it can be extended to much more complex parsing in order to
include other people/objects in the emote, reference things by a short-description etc.

## OPTIONS

    next;n: Paging people -> paging_people
    back;b: Talk on Channels -> goto_command_demo_help(gotonode='talk on channels')
    back to start;start: start
    >: paging_people

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## NODE paging_people

|g** Paging people **|n

Halfway between talking on a |wChannel|n and chatting in your current location
with |wsay|n and |wpose|n, you can also |wpage|n people. This is like a private
message only they can see.

    |ypage <name> = Hello there!
    page <name1>, <name2> = Hello both of you!|n

If you are alone on the server, put your own name as |w<name>|n to test it and
page yourself. Write just |ypage|n to see your latest pages. This will also show
you if anyone paged you while you were offline.

(By the way - depending on which games you are used to, you may think that the
use of |y=|n above is strange. This is a MUSH/MUX-style of syntax. For your own
game you can change the |wpose|n command to work however you prefer).

## OPTIONS

    next;n: Using colors -> testing_colors
    back;b: Talk to people in-game -> comms_demo_start
    back to start;start: start
    >: testing_colors

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## NODE testing_colors

|g** U|rs|yi|gn|wg |c|yc|wo|rl|bo|gr|cs |g**|n

You can add color in your text by the help of tags. However, remember that not
everyone will see your colors - it depends on their client (and some use
screenreaders). Using color can also make text harder to read. So use it
sparingly.

To start coloring something |rred|n, add a ||r (red) marker and then
end with ||n (to go back to neutral/no-color):

    |ysay This is a ||rred||n text!
    say This is a ||Rdark red||n text!|n

You can also change the background:

    |ysay This is a ||[x||bblue text on a light-grey background!|n

There are 16 base colors and as many background colors (called ANSI colors). Some
clients also supports so-called Xterm256 which gives a total of 256 colors. These are
given as |w||rgb|n, where r, g, b are the components of red, green and blue from 0-5:

    |ysay This is ||050solid green!|n
    |ysay This is ||520an orange color!|n
    |ysay This is ||[005||555white on bright blue background!|n

If you don't see the expected colors from the above examples, it's because your
client does not support it - try out the Evennia webclient instead. To see all
color codes printed, try

    |ycolor ansi
    |ycolor xterm

## NODE command_demo_room

|gMoving and Exploring|n

For exploring the game, a very important command is '|ylook|n'. It's also
abbreviated '|yl|n' since it's used so much. Looking displays/redisplays your
current location. You can also use it to look closer at items in the world. So
far in this tutorial, using 'look' would just redisplay the menu.

Try |ylook|n now. You have been quietly transported to a sunny cabin to look
around in. Explore a little and use |ynext|n when you are done.

|gConclusions|n

That concludes this little quick-intro to using the base game commands of
Evennia. With this you should be able to continue exploring and also find help

If you want there is also some |wextra|n info for where to go beyond that.

|gWhere to next?|n

After playing through the tutorial-world quest, if you aim to make a game with
Evennia you are wise to take a look at the |wEvennia documentation|n at

    |yhttps://www.evennia.com/docs/latest

- You can start by trying to build some stuff by following the |wBuilder quick-start|n:

    |yhttps://www.evennia.com/docs/latest/Building-Quickstart|n

- The tutorial-world may or may not be your cup of tea, but it does show off
  several |wuseful tools|n of Evennia. You may want to check out how it works:

    |yhttps://www.evennia.com/docs/latest/Tutorial-World-Introduction|n

- You can then continue looking through the |wTutorials|n and pick one that
  fits your level of understanding.

    |yhttps://www.evennia.com/docs/latest/Tutorials|n

- Make sure to |wjoin our forum|n and connect to our |wsupport chat|n! The
  Evennia community is very active and friendly and no question is too simple.
  You will often quickly get help. You can everything you need linked from
